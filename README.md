# Start Here

The collection of repositories under the UI-CCC organization is a library of collaborative lesson modules suitable for use in engineering classes to cover necessary computational tools.

We will follow the [Software Carpentry template and guidelines on contributing lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).  To contribute, fork the repository on GitHub, add your materials, and submit a pull request.

Code is available under the MIT license, and lesson text and materials are available under the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-4.0 license (unless otherwise specified).
